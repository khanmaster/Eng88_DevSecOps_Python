    - strings, boolean, integers

    - boolean is true or false
    - numbers are ints


```python
first_name = "Shahrukh" # string

last_name = "Khan" # string
print(first_name)

print(last_name)

Salary = 111 # integer 

print(Salary)

```

```python
print(float_value)
# To find out the type of variable we have method called type()
print(type(float_value))
print(type(Salary))
print(type(first_name))

# Taking user input - we have a method called input()

print("Please enter your name ")
name = input("")
print("Hello")
print(name)

```
