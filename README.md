- Testing the python env `print("hello world")`

- What are variables
    - Variables work as a place holder to store data
    - strings, boolean, integers 
    - "is considered as a String"
    - boolean is true or false
    - numbers are ints


```python
first_name = "Shahrukh" # string

last_name = "Khan" # string
print(first_name)

print(last_name)

Salary = 111 # integer 

print(Salary)

```

```python
print(float_value)
# To find out the type of variable we have method called type()
print(type(float_value))
print(type(Salary))
print(type(first_name))

# Taking user input - we have a method called input()

print("Please enter your name ")
name = input("")
print("Hello")
print(name)

```
### Operators

**Artimetic Operators**
` + - * / `

**Comprison Operators**
`> < == != >= <=  `
`%` Modulus - remainder of the division of left operand by the right

## Arithmetic Operators

| Operand    | Description                          | Example    |
|:---------: |:----------------------------:        |:--------:  |
|    +       | add two operands (variables) together| X + y + 2  |
|    -       | subtract two operands (variables)    | X - y - 2  |
|    *       | multiply two operands (variables)    | X - y - 2  |
|    /       | divide two operands (variables)      | X - y - 2  |
    |    %   | Modulus - remainder of the division of left operand by the right    | X - y - 2  |
|    +       | add two operands (variables) together| X + y + 2  |

## Comparison Operators

| Operand    | Description                          | Example         |
|:---------: |:----------------------------:        |:--------:       |
|    >       | True if left operand is greater than the right| x > y  |
|    <       | True if left operand is less than th
e right| x < y     |
|    ==      | True if both operands are equal            | x == y    |
|    !=      | True if both operands are equal            | x != y    |
|    >=      | True if left operand is greater than or equal to the right| x >= y     |
|    <=      | True if left operand is less than or equal to the right| x <= y     |
