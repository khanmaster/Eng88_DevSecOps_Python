# built in methods available in python that give us boolean outcome as well

# Name = "James"
# # isalphla() # checks if the value is alphabetical
#
# print(Name.isalpha()) # returns the boolean outcome
#
#
# print(Name.isdigit()) # checks the value if in digits
#
# print(Name.startswith("J"))

# Why DevSecOps

#  Strings, Concatenation and Casting

#single_quotes = 'hello world'

#greetings = "Hello World!"
# H E L L O   W O R L  D   !
# 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  11
# To find out the length of the strings we can use method called len()

#print(len(greetings))

# String slicing
# print(greetings[0:2])

# white_spaces = "lot's of spaces at the end                                      "
# print("strings with empty spaces")
# print(len(white_spaces))
# print(len(white_spaces.strip()))
#print("strings without spaces")


# Example_text = "here's SOME text with lot's of text"
# print(Example_text.count("text")) # count how many times text is written in the string stored in Example test
#
# print(Example_text.lower())#  brings everything lowercase()
# print(Example_text.upper()) # changes the string to upper case
# print(Example_text.capitalize())
#
# print(Example_text.replace("with", ","))

# Concatenation? combining values, variables, strings together

First_Name = "James"
Last_Name = "Bond"
age = "99"

#print(First_Name + " " + Last_Name + " " + (age))
print(f"{First_Name} {Last_Name} is {age}  Old")

#print(type(str(age)))

# str() is the method that converts integer value into string
# Casting - casting string into int or int into string

# Find the method to cast string into an integer and display the value and the type after conversion
